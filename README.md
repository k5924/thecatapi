## About The Project

![Screen Shot](example.png)

For this project, I needed to:
1. Sign up and create an API key at [thecatapi](https://thecatapi.com)
2. Create an app that retrieves some data from one of the cat API endpoints (of my choice) and renders it on a web page.
3. Send a link for the git repo where the code is hosted to the hiring manager. The root folder of this repo should contain a screenshot showing my app rendering the cat data.

## Built With

This project was supposed to be built with a web development framework however, as I am not that knowledgeable in JavaScript frameworks, I developed the web app in Flutter.
